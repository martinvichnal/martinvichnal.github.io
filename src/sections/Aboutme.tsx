                    I am an Electrical Engineer student at Ã“budai University in
                    Budapest. My main interests are IoT and embedded systems and
                    web development, but I am also interested in other fields of
                    software development. I am currently working on a project
                    that combines IoT and web development. All my web
                    development projects are public on my GitHub profile, feel
                    free to check them out.
